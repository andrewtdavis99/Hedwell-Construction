            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p class="pback1">
                Our background started in high voltage electrical solutions working on some of the biggest projects in
                the UK.
                Working on these projects ensured we worked to the highest possible standard and in doing so gained a
                sterling reputation for professionalism and quality of work.
                While doing these large electrical installs we tackled challenges such as drainage, humidity and making
                ground up.
            </p>
            <p class="pback2">We then expanded into bus stop replacement for the Thames Link Transport. This was
                replacing the old bus
                stops with a new bus stop produced by an engineering company in London which had advanced advertising
                capability.
                We now have contacts within this field and can offer this service across the UK. However, as a company
                based in South Nottinghamshire, we would like to offer this service in a local area.
            </p>
            <p class="pback3">The bus stops could be a massive revenue creator for the authority from local business.
                With the stops
                offering electronic adverts there is nearly limitless storage so a village bus stop could hold every
                village business along with surrounding businesses from other villages on the route.
                Not only does this service increase business in the local area but gives any village a smart and
                professional look.
            </p>
            <p class="pback4">We did not stop there, after bus stops, we expanded into play equipment and general street
                furniture,
                benches and shelters. We offer all the services with a power supply for lighting with renewable energy
                options.
                We intend to offer a full turnkey solution to any project. You will be safe in our hands and our
                extended warranties will ensure your peace of mind, backed up with our 24-7 call out service.
            </p>
            <p class="pback5">We would relish the opportunity for a presentation to showcase our services to not only
                increase revenue
                for the authority but also provide a cost-effective solution to current requirements with pipeline
                projects that require street works.
